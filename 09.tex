\subsection{$p$-groups}

\index{Action!fixed points}
\index{Class equation}
Let $G$ be a group and
$X$ be a finite $G$-set. Then $X$ decomposes as a disjoint 
union of orbits. Let 
\[
\Fix(X)=\{x\in X:g\cdot x=x\text{ for all $g\in G$}\}
\]
be the set of \textbf{fixed points} of $X$. Gather  
the one-element orbits and apply cardinality. By the 
fundamental counting principle, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:clases}
|X|=|\Fix(X)|+\sum_{i=1}^k|G\cdot x_i|
=|\Fix(X)|+\sum_{i=1}^k(G:G_{x_i}),
\end{equation}
where the $x_j$'s are the representatives
of the orbits of size $\geq2$. Equality~\eqref{eq:clases} is extremely 
useful and is called the 
\textbf{class equation}.

\begin{example}
Let a finite group $G$ act on $G$ by conjugation. 
Then $\Fix(G)=Z(G)$ and 
\[
|G|=|Z(G)|+\sum_{i=1}^k(G:C_G(x_i)),
\]
for some $x_1,\dots,x_k\in G$ such that 
$(G:C_G(x_i))\geq2$ for all $i\in\{1,\dots,k\}$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
\index{$p$-group}
Let $p$ be a prime number. We say 
that $G$ is a \textbf{$p$-group} if $|G|=p^m$ for some $m\geq0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Let $p$ be a prime number and 
$G$ a $p$-group. If $\{1\}\ne N\unlhd G$, then
$N\cap Z(G)\ne\{1\}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since $N$ is normal in $G$, $G$ acts on $N$ by conjugation. 
By the fundamental counting principle,
each orbit has prime-power size. Write 
\[
N=\underbrace{\mathcal{O}_1\cup\cdots\cup \mathcal{O}_k}_{\text{one-element orbits}}\cup\underbrace{\mathcal{O}_{k+1}\cup\cdots\cup\mathcal{O}_m}_{\text{orbits of size $>1$}},
\]
Since $N\cap Z(G)=\mathcal{O}_1\cup\cdots\cup\mathcal{O}_k$, 
the integers $k=|N\cap Z(G)|$ and $|N\setminus(N\cap Z(G))|$ are divisible by $p$. Thus 
\[
|N|\equiv|N\cap Z(G)|\bmod p.
\]
Since $1\in N\cap Z(G)$, then
$|N\cap Z(G)|>1$. In particular, $N\
cap Z(G)\ne\{1\}$.
\end{proof}

The following corollary follows immediately: 

\begin{corollary}
Let $p$ be a prime number and 
$G$ a $p$-group. Then 
$Z(G)\ne\{1\}$.
\end{corollary}

In Exercises \ref{xca:size4} and \ref{xca:size9}
we proved that groups of order four and nine are always abelian. 

\begin{corollary}
    Let $p$ be a prime number. If $G$ is a group of order $p^2$, 
    then $G$ is abelian. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
By Lagrange's theorem, $|Z(G)|\in\{1,p,p^2\}$. Since $G$ 
is a $p$-group, $Z(G)\ne\{1\}$. If $|Z(G)|=p$, then $G/Z(G)$ 
is cyclic. By Exercise \ref{xca:G/Z(G)}, 
$G$ is abelian, a contradiction. 
Thus $|Z(G)|=p^2$ and hence $G=Z(G)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Cauchy's theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Cauchy]
\index{Cauchy's theorem}
\label{thm:Cauchy}
Let $G$ be a finite group, and $p$ be a prime number
that divides $|G|$. 
Then there exists $g\in G$ of order $p$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $C=\Z/p$ and 
\[
X=\{(x_1,\dots,x_p)\in G\times\cdots\times G:x_1\cdots x_p=1\}.
\]
Then $C$ acts on $X$ by $k\cdot (x_1,\dots,x_p)=(x_{k+1},\dots,x_{k+p})$, where the indices are taken modulo $p$. To see that
this is an action, note that 
\[
x_{i_1}\cdots x_{i_p}=1
\implies (x_{i_1}^{-1}x_{i_1})x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_p}=x_{i_1}^{-1}
\implies x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_p}x_{i_1}=1.
\]
If $x_1,\dots,x_{p-1}$ are fixed, then 
$x_p=x_{p-1}^{-1}\cdots x_{1}^{-1}$. Thus $|X|=|G|^{p-1}$. Each $C$-orbit
has either one or $p$ elements, as $|C|=p$. Write
\[
X=\underbrace{\mathcal{O}_1\cup\cdots\cup \mathcal{O}_k}_{\text{one-element orbits}}\cup\underbrace{\mathcal{O}_{k+1}\cup\cdots\cup\mathcal{O}_m}_{\text{orbits of size $p$}}.
\]
Hence $0\equiv |G|^{p-1}=|X|\equiv k\bmod p$, that is $p$ divides $k$. Since $(1,1,\dots,1)\in X$, $k\geq 1$. Therefore $p\leq k$. In particular,
there exists $x\in G\setminus\{1\}$ such that $(x,x,\dots,x)\in X$. Hence $|x|=p$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    Let $p$ be a prime number and $G$ be a finite group. 
    Then $G$ is a $p$-group if and only if 
    every element of $G$ has order a power of $p$. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    If $G$ is a $p$-group, then, by Lagrange's theorem, 
    every element has order a power of $p$. Conversely, 
    if $q$ is a prime divisor of $|G|$, by 
    Cauchy's theorem, there exists $g\in G$ of order $q$. Thus $q=p$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    Let $p>2$ be a prime number 
    and $G$ be a group of order $2p$. 
    Then either $G\simeq\Z/2p$ or $G\simeq\D_p$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    By Cauchy's theorem, there exist $r,s\in G$ such that
    $|r|=p$ and $|s|=2$. Let $H=\langle r\rangle$. Then
    $(G:H)=2$ and $H\unlhd G$. We can decompose $G$ as 
    $G=H\cup Hs$ (disjoint union), 
    as $s\not\in H$. In particular, 
\[
G=\{1,r,\dots,r^{p-1},s,rs,\dots,r^{p-1}s\}.
\]
Since $srs^{-1}\in H$, it follows that $srs^{-1}=r^k$ for some
$k\in\{0,1,\dots,p-1\}$. Since $s^2=1$,
\[
r=s^2rs^{-2}=s(srs^{-1})s^{-1}=sr^ks^{-1}=r^{k^2}.
\]
Thus $k^2\equiv 1\bmod p$ and either 
$k\equiv 1\bmod p$ or $k\equiv-1\bmod p$. 
If $k\equiv -1\bmod p$, then $srs^{-1}=r^{-1}$ and hence $G\simeq\D_p$.
If $k\equiv 1\bmod p$, then $rs=sr$ and hence, since $G$ is abelian, $G\simeq\Z/{2p}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    A group of order $p^m$ has a normal subgroup of order
    $p^n$ for every $n\leq m$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We proceed by induction on $m$. The case where $m=1$ is trivial. Assume that the result holds for groups of order $p^m$. Let
    $G$ be a group of order $p^{m+1}$.
    We claim that if $n\leq m$, $G$ contains a normal subgroup of
    order $p^n$. Since $Z(G)\ne\{1\}$, there exists
    $g\in Z(G)\setminus\{1\}$ of order $p$. Let
$N=\langle g\rangle\unlhd G$. The quotient 
group $G/N$ has order $p^m$. By the inductive hypothesis, 
there exists a normal subgroup $Y$ of $G/N$ of order $p^n$. By the correspondence theorem, $G$ contains a normal subgroup $K$ of $G$ 
that contains $N$, that is $N\leq K\leq G$. In fact, 
$Y=\pi(K)$ and 
$(G:K)=(\pi(G):\pi(K))=p^{m-n}$. Hence $|K|=p^n$.
\end{proof}
