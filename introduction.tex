\section*{Introduction}

The notes correspond to the bachelor 
course \textbf{Group Theory} of the 
Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 
Faculty of Sciences, 
Department of Mathematics and Data Sciences. The course
is divided into twelve two-hour lectures. 

The material is somewhat standard. Basic texts on abstract algebra
are for example \cite{MR1129886}, \cite{MR2286236} and \cite{MR600654}. 
Lang's book \cite{MR783636} is also a standard reference, but 
maybe a bit more advanced. 

We also mention a set of 
\href{https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/}{great expository papers} by Keith Conrad. 
The notes are extremely well-written and are useful at  
every stage of a mathematical career.
