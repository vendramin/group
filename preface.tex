The notes correspond to the bachelor 
course \emph{Ring and Modules} of the 
Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 
Faculty of Sciences, 
Department of Mathematics and Data Sciences. The course
is divided into twelve or thirteen two-hours lectures. 

The material is somewhat standard. Basic texts on abstract algebra
are for example \cite{MR1129886}, \cite{MR2286236} and \cite{MR600654}. 
Lang's book \cite{MR783636} is also a standard reference, but 
maybe a little bit more advanced. 
We based the lectures on representation theory of finite
groups on \cite{MR0450380} and 
\cite{MR2867444}. 

We also mention a set of great expository papers by 
Keith Conrad available at 
\url{https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/}. 
The notes are extremely well-written and are useful at  
every stage of a mathematical career.
