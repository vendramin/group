\topic{Groups}

Before defining groups, we recall that a binary operation on a set $X$
is simply a map 
\[
X\times X\to X,
\quad (x,y)\mapsto xy.
\]
Note that we have used 
juxtaposition to denote this generic binary operation. For example,
$(x,y)\mapsto x-y$ is a binary operation in $\Z$ but not, for example, 
in $\Z_{\geq 0}$.

\begin{definition}
\index{Group}
A \textbf{group} is a non-empty set $G$ with a binary operation
$G\times G\to G$, $(x,y)\mapsto xy$, such that
the following properties hold:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item (Associativity) $(xy)z=x(yz)$ for all $x,y,z\in R$.
    \item (Existence of a neutral element) There exists $e\in G$ such that $xe=ex=x$ for all $x\in G$.
    \item (Existence of inverses) For every $x\in G$ there exists $y\in G$ such that $xy=yx=e$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The associativity condition implies
that all ordered products that we can form with 
the elements, say, $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ will be equal. For example,
\[
(x_1x_2)((x_3x_4)x_5)=x_1(x_2(x_3(x_4x_5)))
\]
and hence we can write, without ambiguity (and without using brackets), 
$x_1x_2\cdots x_5$. This fact can be proved by induction; see for example
Lang's book. We will provide an alternative proof as an application
of Cayley's theorem. 

\begin{proposition}
    In a group $G$, every element $x\in G$ admits a unique inverse.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let $y,z\in G$ be inverses of $x\in G$. Then 
    $z=z(xy)=(zx)y=ey=y$.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
    Prove that the neutral element of a group is unique. 
\end{exercise}

In general, when the binary operation is written multiplicatively, one
writes the identity element $e$ of a group as $1_G$ or simply as $1$. The inverse of $x$ will be 
denoted by $x^{-1}$. 

\begin{example}
    Let $n\geq1$. The set $\GL_n(\R)$ of $n\times n$ invertible real 
matrices forms a
    group with the usual matrix multiplication.  
\end{example}

It is a good idea to keep in mind the \emph{group of invertible matrices}. 
With this, the 
the following properties look familiar:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(x^{-1})^{-1}=x$ for all $x$.
    \item $(xy)^{-1}=y^{-1}x^{-1}$ for all $x,y$. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
    Prove that in a group, the equation $ax=b$ has 
    a unique solution $x=a^{-1}b$. Similarly, the equation
    $x=ba^{-1}$ is the unique solution of the equation
    $xa=b$. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{definition}
    \index{Group!abelian}
    A group $G$ is \textbf{abelian} if $xy=yx$ for all $x,y\in G$. 
\end{definition}

Most of the time, for abelian groups we will use 
the \emph{additive notation}. This means that the binary operation
of the group will be denoted by $(x,y)\mapsto x+y$, the neutral
element by $0$ and 
the inverse of an element $x$ will be $-x$. 

\begin{definition}
    \index{Group!order}
    The \textbf{order} $|G|$ of a group $G$ is the 
    cardinality of $G$. A group $G$ is said to be
    \textbf{finite} if $|G|$ is finite and \textbf{infinite}
    otherwise. 
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\label{exa:abelian_groups}
    Let us see some 
    abelian groups: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Z$, $\Q$, $\R$ and $\C$ with the usual addition. 
        \item Let $n\geq2$. The set $\Z/n$ of integers modulo $n$ with the usual addition modulo $n$.
        \item $\Q\setminus\{0\}$, $\R\setminus\{0\}$ and $\C\setminus\{0\}$ 
        with the usual multiplication.
        \item Let $p$ be a prime number. The set $(\Z/p)^{\times}=(\Z/p)\setminus\{0\}$ of invertible integers modulo $p$ 
            with the usual multiplication modulo $p$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

The groups of the first two items will be written in additive notation. 

The group $\Z/n$ of integers modulo $n$ is a finite group of order $n$. 
The group $(\Z/p)^{\times}$ of units modulo $p$ is a finite
group of order $p-1$. The other groups of Example \ref{exa:abelian_groups} are infinite groups. 

\begin{exercise}
\label{xca:LR}
Let $G$ be a group and $g\in G$. Prove that 
the maps $L_g\colon G\to G$, $x\mapsto gx$, and 
$R_g\colon G\to G$, $x\mapsto xg$, are bijective. 
\end{exercise}

\index{Group!table}
Let $G=\{g_1,g_2,\dots,g_n\}$ be a finite group. The \textbf{table} 
of $G$ is the matrix 
that in position $(i,j)$ has the element $g_ig_j$. 
For example, the table of 
the additive group  
$\Z/4$ of integers modulo 4 is the following:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l|cccc}
     &0&1&2&3 \\
    \hline
    0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3\\
    1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 0\\
    2 & 2 & 3 & 0 & 1\\
    3 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 2
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

We know that $\Z$ is a group with the usual addition. 
We now discuss a multiplicative version of this group, as it will be
very important later. We first need a little bit of notation. 
Let $G$ be a group and $g\in G$. For $k\in\Z\setminus\{0\}$, we write 
\begin{align*}
                & g^k=g\cdots g\quad (k-\text{times}) && \text{if $k>0$},\\
                & g^k=g^{-1}\cdots g^{-1}\quad (|k|-\text{times}) && \text{if $k
<0$}.
\end{align*}
By convention, $g^0=1$.
The following facts are left as an exercise: 
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item $(g^k)^l=g^{kl}$ for all $k,l\in\Z$.
                \item If $G$ is abelian, then $(xy)^k=x^ky^k$ for all $x,y\in G$
                        and $k\in\Z$.
        \end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
\label{exa:cyclic}
Fix a formal symbol $g$. Consider the set  
\[
\langle g\rangle=\{g^k:k\in\Z\}
\]
of integers powers of $g$ (with the usual convention $g^0=1$). Then
$\langle g\rangle$
with the operation $g^ig^j=g^{i+j}$ is an abelian group. 
\end{example}

We will see later that $\Z$ and the group of 
Example \ref{exa:cyclic} are ``indistinguishable'' 
as groups, even if they appear to be completely different. 

\begin{example}
Let $n$ be a positive integer. The set 
$G_n=\{z\in\C:z^n=1\}$ is an abelian group with
the usual multiplication. Moreover, the set 
$\cup_{n\geq1}G_n$ is an abelian group. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Let $X$ be a set. The set $\Sym_X$ of bijective maps $X\to X$ 
    is a group with the usual composition of maps. If $|X|\geq3$, the group
    $\mathbb{S}_{X}$ is non-abelian. To prove this, let $a,b,c\in
        X$ be three different elemants. Let $f\colon X\to X$ be such that
        $f(a)=b$, $f(b)=c$ and $f(c)=
a$ and $g\colon X\to
        X$ be such that $g(a)=b$, $g(b)=a$ and $g(x)=x$ for all $x\in
        X\setminus\{a,b\}$.  Then $fg\ne gf$.
\end{example}

\index{Permutation}
\index{Group!symmetric}
If $X=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, the group $\Sym_X$ will be written as $\Sym_n$. This is
the \textbf{symmetric group} of degree $n$. The elements of $\Sym_n$ are
called \textbf{permutations} of degree $n$. 
Note that $|\Sym_n|=n!$ and $\Sym_n$
is abelian if and only if $n\in\{1,2\}$. Each element of $\Sym_n$ is a 
bijective map 
$f\colon\{1,\dots,n\}\to \{1,\dots,n\}$. To denote permutations, 
we can use the following convention. The symbol  
\[
\binom{12345}{32145}
\]
denotes the map 
$f\colon\{1,2,3,4,5\}\to\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ such that 
\[
f(1)=3,
\quad f(2)=2,
\quad f(3)=1, 
\quad f(4)=4,
\quad f(5)=5.
\]


\begin{example}[Klein group]
\index{Klein group}
The set  
\[
K=\left\{ \mathrm{id},\binom{1234}{2143},\binom{1234}{3412},\binom{1234}{4321}\right\}
\]
together with the usual composition of maps is an abelian group. 
Note that $K$ is included in $\mathbb{S}_{4}$.
Can you compute the table of this group?
\end{example}

Every permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles. The fact 
is proved by induction, but is rather intuitive. Let us 
decompose the permutation 
\[
\sigma=\binom{123456789}{638915724}\in\Sym_9
\]
as a product of cycles. We just need to 
draw a picture for $\sigma$:


\begin{example}
\label{exa:S3}
\index{Symmetric group $\Sym_3$}
The set $\Sym_3$ of bijective maps $\{1,2,3\}\to\{1,2,3\}$
together with the composition of maps is a group of order six. 
Its elements are the permutations 
        \[
        \id,\binom{123}{213},\binom{123}{321},\binom{123}{132},\binom{123}{231},
\binom{123}{312}.
        \]
        There is a handy way of writing permutations. It is based on \emph{decomposing
        permutations as a product of disjoint cycles}. 
        In this particular case, the elements of $\Sym_3$ 
        are        
        \[
                \id,(12),(13),(23),(123),(132),
        \]
        where, for example, the symbol $(12)$ represents 
        the map $\{1,2,3\}\to\{1,2,3\}$ such that 
        $1\mapsto 2$, $2\mapsto 1$ and $3\mapsto 3$. Can you construct the table of this group? 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\label{exa:another_S3}
The set of maps 
\[
G=\left\{x,\frac{1}{x},1-x,\frac{1}{1-x},\frac{x}{x-1},\frac{x-1}{x}\right\}
\]
is a non-abelian group with the usual composition of maps. 
Let $\overline{\R}=\R\cup\{\infty\}$ (here $\infty$ is just a symbol) 
and assume that the following rules hold: 
\[
1/\infty=0,
\quad 1/\infty,
\quad \infty/\infty=1,
\quad 1-\infty=\infty-1=\infty.
\]
Then
$G$ is the set of bijective maps 
$\{0,1,\infty\}\to\{0,1,\infty\}$. For example, 
the map $x\mapsto\frac{1}{x}$ can be identified with the permutation of
the set 
$\{0,1,\infty\}$ that permutes $0$ and $\infty$ and fixes $1$. Similarly, 
$\frac{1}{1-x}$ permutes the elements $\{0,1,\infty\}$ cyclically 
in the following way:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
        0 \\
        & 1 \\
        \infty
        \arrow[from=1-1, to=2-2]
        \arrow[from=2-2, to=3-1]
        \arrow[from=3-1, to=1-1]
\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{example}

We will see later that the 
groups of Examples \ref{exa:S3} and \ref{exa:another_S3} are
indeed ``indistinguishable'' as groups. 

\begin{example}
Let $n\geq2$. The units of $\Z/n$ form a group 
with the usual multiplication modulo $n$. We will use the following notation:
\[
\mathcal{U}(\Z/n)=\{x\in\Z/n:\gcd(x,n)=1\}.
\]
The order of $\mathcal{U}(\Z/n)$ is $\varphi(n)$, where $\varphi$ 
is the Euler's function, that is 
\[
\varphi(n)=|\{x\in\Z:1\leq x\leq n,\,\gcd(x,n)=1\}|.
\]

Let us discuss a concrete example. The table of 
$\mathcal{U}(\Z/8)=\{1,3,5,7\}$
is
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l|cccc}
     &1&3&5&7 \\
    \hline
    1 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 7\\
    3 & 3 & 1 & 7 & 5\\
    5 & 5 & 7 & 1 & 3\\
    7 & 7 & 5 & 3 & 1
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
\label{exa:direct_product}
        \index{Direct product!of groups}
        Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. Prove that 
        the set 
        $G\times H$
        of pairs $(g,h)$, where $g\in G$ and 
        $h\in H$, is a group with
        the operation
        \[
                (g,h)(g_1,h_1)=(gg_1,hh_1).
        \]
        This group is called the 
        \textbf{direct product} of $G$ and $H$.
\end{exercise}

The construction of Example \ref{exa:direct_product}
can be easily generalized to the product of 
three or more groups.
